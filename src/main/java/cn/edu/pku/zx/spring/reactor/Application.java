/**
 * 
 The Reactor environment is defined with the environment() method. The
 * environment gets fed into the reactor() method to create an asynchronous
 * reactor. In this case, you are using the THREAD_POOL dispatcher.
 * 
 * It also defines the number of events to send at the top with NUMBER_OF_QUOTES
 * and creates a CountDownLatch with the latch() method.
 * 
 * The Application class is tagged with the @Configuration and @ComponentScan
 * annotations. This lets it define the application context while also scanning
 * the hello package for the @Service objects.
 * 
 * The main() method fetches the reactor and the receiver. It then registers the
 * receiver to digest events on the "quotes" selector. With everything
 * registered, it uses the Publisher to send out a series of quote-fetching
 * events.
 * 
 * The CountDownLatch then waits until every thread reports that itâ€™s done
 * before proceeding.
 *
